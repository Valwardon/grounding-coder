# Grounding Coder — Progress

## Goal
Pivot grounded from an overly ambitious cognitive engine into a deterministic, non-guessing coding agent for Android — `grounding-coder`. The LLM is ONLY an unverified NL→intent translator; all code generation, verification, and correction is driven by grounded's deterministic engine patterns.

## Architecture

### Determinism Guarantee
- **LLM (unverified)**: OpenRouter API client → translates NL → structured intent JSON only. NEVER writes code.
- **Engine (deterministic)**: TaskDecomposer → RetryBudget → SymbolBinder → CodeVerifier → CorrectionPipeline
- **Compiler as oracle**: `cargo check/test/clippy` → never guesses, always verifies

### Key Components (all repurposed from grounded)
| Grounded Component | Grounding-Coder Repurposing |
|---|---|
| GraphArena | CodeArena — arena-backed graph of code symbols |
| KnowledgeStore | SymbolTable — embedded API ref + runtime cache |
| CuriosityBudget | RetryBudget — energy-bounded correction attempts |
| DefinitionResolver | SymbolBinder via SymbolTable.fetch() |
| VerificationLoop | CodeVerifier — cargo check/test/clippy |
| SelfHealingPipeline | CorrectionPipeline — 5-phase error correction |
| GoalFormationEngine | TaskDecomposer — breaks intent into sub-tasks |
| EpisodicRecorder | RecipeLog — error→fix recipe database |
| Motor System | CodeWriter — composes code from verified patterns |

### ResearchOracle (added during development)
Solves the "no code generation from fresh project" flaw. When the bot encounters unknown symbols, it fetches definitions from verified sources:
- docs.rs (Rust crate docs)
- developer.android.com (Android SDK)
- crates.io API (crate metadata)
- kotlinlang.org (Kotlin docs)

All fetched definitions are compiler-verified before caching. The bot never trusts broken code.

## Build & Run

### CLI (any platform)
```bash
cargo run --bin gc -- --help          # Show commands
cargo run --bin gc -- chat "prompt"   # Chat with the bot
cargo run --bin gc -- symbols -p .    # List indexed symbols
cargo run --bin gc -- recipes         # List fix recipes
```

### Android APK
```bash
dx build --platform android --release --features ui
# APK: target/dx/gc/release/android/app/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Deliverables

- Release: https://github.com/Valwardon/grounding-coder/releases/tag/v0.2.0 (updated)
- APK: `app-debug.apk` (9.7MB) uploaded to release
